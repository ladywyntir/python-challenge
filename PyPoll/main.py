# Module 3 - Python Challenge PyBank -  Main.py
# Created by Marjorie MuÃ±oz
#
# Create a Python script to analyze the voting data from election_data.csv. You must find:
#
#   - The total number of votes cast
#   - A complete list of candidates who received votes
#   - The percentage of votes each candidate won
#   - The total number of votes each candidate won
#   - The winner of the election based on popular vote
#
# Results should look like this:
# Election Results
# -------------------------
# Total Votes: 369711
# -------------------------
# Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
# Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
# Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
# -------------------------
# Winner: Diana DeGette
# -------------------------
