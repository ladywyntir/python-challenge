# Module 3 - Python Challenge PyBank -  Main.py
# Created by Marjorie Mu√±oz
#
# Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Use the csv budget_data.csv
# in the resources folder. You must find:
#   - Total months in dataset  
#   - Net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
#   - Changes in "Profit/Losses" over entire period
#   - Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
#   - Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
#
# Results should look like this:
#   Financial Analysis
#   ----------------------------
#   Total Months: 86
#   Total: $22564198
#   Average Change: $-8311.11
#   Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
#   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
#
# The analysis should be displayed in terminal and exported to a text file.
